// Design: "worker + buffer_sem(3N) + consumer self-built slot" — N workers
// pop targets from a shared queue and fetch concurrently; a
// `Semaphore(concurrency * 3)` bounds total outstanding slots (InFlight +
// Ready-unconsumed) to 3N, matching v1 `semaphore(N) + channel(2N) = 3N`
// backpressure. Each worker stores its `OwnedSemaphorePermit` inside the
// slot it creates; the permit is released when the consumer drops the slot
// after reading.
//
// When the consumer (transmuxer) races ahead of prefetch — i.e. calls
// `read_bytes` for a target no worker has reached yet — it self-builds a
// slot with `_buffer_permit = None` and spawns a one-shot fetch. Workers
// popping that target later see an existing slot and skip it (releasing
// their freshly-acquired buffer_permit). This mirrors v1's "consumer waits
// on `rx.recv()` when channel is empty" semantics and avoids redundant
// downloads competing for bandwidth.
//
// Why not BTreeMap by index? The Source trait API is URL-based, not
// index-based. The transmuxer already consumes segments in playlist order,
// so the Source only needs point lookups by URL — no ordered reassembly.
